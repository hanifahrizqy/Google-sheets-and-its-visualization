# Google-sheets-and-its-visualization

First of all, aim for this project is to be a database for any small company who need it to make the input as simple as could be.
So, here's the explanation of this project. First i made the table in Google sheets for the database with Apps Script like VBA in excel form. And then I proceed into visualization, so we can clearly see the progress of sales or whatever you filled in that table. And then the boss or anywho can make the decision more accurate.
In the google sheets ther's more notes in "Readme" sheet. So, you will know how my database works.
